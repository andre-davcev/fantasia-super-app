Angular

1. Use trackBy with *ngFor
2. Lazy load modules via routing
3. Change detection using OnPush
4. Events will trigger change detection even with OnPush
5. Unsubscribe/complete all Observables
6. Only use primitives for iterated pipes

ng -v
ng new <app-name> —style scss —routing
ng serve -o
ng add @angular/pwa
ng update
ng doc ViewChild
